        Step 1:  Create several instances of the Money class using the various constructors.
        Test the class by printing out the values using the getter methods and the toString method.
        Test the add method by adding together two instances of Money objects.
        Remember that the add method returns a new object of the type Money. It does NOT modify
        any values in the existing objects.

        Does the Money class correctly handle all possibilities for input?  Did you check edge cases?
        Also, for the purpose of this exercise, the Money object should not allow negative values.


        Step 2:  Have the parameterized constructor normalize the arguments. That is, convert cents to dollars and cents if cents > 99.
        Modify the add method to normalize the returned object as well.
        Modify the constructor to zero out any negative inputs.

        Step 3:  Include a subtract method that subtracts the paramater from the instance to which it is applied.
        There are several ways we can handle a resulting negative amount.  We could crash the program,
        simply zero out the result, ignore the method if the result is zero, or throw an exception.
        For now, if the result is negative, zero out the returning object and print an error message.  Later we will look at how to throw
        an exception.*/
